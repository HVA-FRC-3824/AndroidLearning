# Debugging:

*This is based on resources developed by FRC Team 1678

1. Where in the code is the bug happening?

  * Line # or specific var. or part of line.

2. Do you understand your code completely?

  * Do you need to look at documentation? (to learn how methods/classes you are using work)

3. Do you understand the error message?

  * At least the parts that are relevant

4. What are the values of the involved variables?

  * Print/debugger

5. Is there someone else who could provide a second opinion/perspective?

6. Is there another way to write the same code that would not cause the same problem to arise?

7. Run around until you are tired, then sit back down and think again with determination

8. If you get to this step, Iâ€™m sorry. When you do figure it out, add something to this document so we can all get better at debugging.
