Now that you have created your first widget we are going to make a couple that
are a little more difficult:

- A set of radio buttons that each have a label as well as a main label (Hint:
one of the attributes should use a reference format).

- A non-editable counter that increments when anywhere in the widget is clicked and decrements
when there is a **long** click. Also a label should be attached.
